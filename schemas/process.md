# Process Pack Schema

*Blueprint for ExpertPacks that capture a complex process — multi-phase endeavors like building a home, starting a business, or designing a landscape. This schema extends [core.md](core.md); all shared principles apply.*

---

## Purpose

A process pack turns an AI agent into an expert guide for a complex, multi-phase process. Unlike a product pack (which documents a specific tool) or a person pack (which captures a human), a process pack captures the *how-to* of a significant real-world endeavor — the phases, decisions, gotchas, and tribal knowledge that separate experienced practitioners from beginners.

The target user is someone undertaking a process for the first (or second) time who needs structured guidance without hiring a full-time consultant.

**Examples:**
- Architecting and building a new home
- Starting and incorporating a new business
- Creating a professional landscape design
- Planning and executing a kitchen renovation
- Setting up a home recording studio
- Navigating the private pilot certification process

---

## High-level design goals

1. Capture the sequential flow (phases) and the decision points that cause branches.
2. Surface the hard-won heuristics (gotchas) and examples that make novices competent quickly.
3. Provide the operational artifacts people actually need: checklists, templates, budgets, schedules, and regulatory references.
4. Keep files small and focused so RAG retrieves precise chunks (1–3KB per file guideline).
5. Make the pack discoverable via `_index.md` files and manifest-declared context tiers.

├── gotchas/               ← Common mistakes, traps, and prevention patterns
└── faq/                   ← Frequently asked questions by category
```

Notes:
- Each directory should include `_index.md` describing contents and links to files.
- Files should be named kebab-case and kept focused (one topic per file).
- `fundamentals/` and `glossary/` help novices build mental models before they act.
- `gotchas/` captures preventive knowledge ("don't forget X"); `exceptions/` captures reactive knowledge ("X happened, now what").

## Component Templates (high-level)

Below are templates and guidance for the most important directories.

### Overview (`overview.md`)

Keep this short and always-loadable. The agent should load this on every session to understand the pack's scope.

```markdown
# {Process Name}

## What This Process Is
One paragraph describing the end result and who benefits.

## Who This Is For
Primary audience and skill level.

## Typical Duration & Cost
High-level ranges and major cost drivers.

## Phase Map
The ordered sequence of all phases with dependencies and typical durations.
This is the structural backbone — an agent reads this to understand the
full process arc before diving into any specific phase.

1. **[{Phase 1}](phases/{phase-1}.md)** — {one-line purpose} ({duration})
2. **[{Phase 2}](phases/{phase-2}.md)** — {one-line purpose} ({duration})
   - Depends on: Phase 1 completion
3. **[{Phase 3}](phases/{phase-3}.md)** — {one-line purpose} ({duration})
   - Depends on: Phase 2 deliverables
   - Can run in parallel with: Phase 4
4. **[{Phase 4}](phases/{phase-4}.md)** — {one-line purpose} ({duration})

## Major Variants
Brief summary of the major forks in this process. See [variants.md](variants.md)
for full detail on how each variant changes the phase sequence.

- **{Variant A}** — {how it differs, which phases change}
- **{Variant B}** — {how it differs, which phases change}

## When to Get Professional Help
Which parts typically require external experts.
```

### Fundamentals (`fundamentals/{topic}.md`)

Conceptual material that helps the user understand *why* steps exist.

```markdown
# Fundamentals: {Topic}

## What It Is
Short definition and why it matters.

## How It Works
High-level mechanics and mental models.

## Where It Shows Up
Links to phases/decisions where this concept matters.

## Further Reading
Links to deeper resources.
```

### Glossary (`glossary/{term}.md`)

Short, plain-English definitions for domain terms. Useful for RAG when users ask "what is X?".

### Phases (`phases/{phase}.md`)

Phases are the backbone of the process. Each phase file is a self-contained guide to that stage — what goes in, what happens, what comes out, and what can go wrong.

```markdown
# Phase: {Phase Name}

## Overview
What this phase accomplishes and why it matters.

## Inputs / Prerequisites
What must exist before this phase can start:
- **Preceding phases:** [{Phase X}]({phase-x}.md) must be complete
- **Artifacts needed:** {documents, approvals, materials, decisions}
- **Conditions:** {seasonal, regulatory, financial readiness}

## Completion Triggers
How to know this phase is done — not just "activities finished" but
observable criteria an agent can verify:
- [ ] {Deliverable 1} produced and approved
- [ ] {Inspection/review} passed
- [ ] {Handoff} to {next phase/role} completed

## Duration & Lead Times
Typical duration and items with long lead times (e.g., windows, custom cabinets).

## Key Activities
- Activity 1
- Activity 2

## Roles Involved
Who participates in this phase and what they do:
- **{Role}** — {responsibility in this phase}
- **{Role}** — {responsibility in this phase}

## Deliverables
Artifacts produced at the end of the phase.

## Handoffs
What gets passed to the next phase and to whom:
- **To [{Next Phase}]({next-phase}.md):** {what artifacts/approvals transfer}
- **To [{Role}](../roles/{role}.md):** {what they need to receive}

## Budget Items
Summarize the major budget lines relevant to this phase and link to budget files.

## Variants
How this phase changes under different process variants (if applicable):
- **{Variant A}:** {what's different — skipped steps, additional requirements, different roles}
- **{Variant B}:** {what's different}
See [variants.md](../variants.md) for the full variant overview.

## Checklist
Link to `checklists/{phase}-checklist.md`.

## Common Mistakes
Link to gotchas.

## What Can Go Wrong
Link to relevant `exceptions/` files for failure modes specific to this phase.
```

### Decisions (`decisions/{decision}.md`)

Decision templates unchanged — emphasize cost, schedule, and risk tradeoffs. Always link to phases and budget impact.

### Checklists (`checklists/{checklist}.md`)

Actionable items with verification steps and sign-off criteria.

### Scheduling (`scheduling/{schedule}.md`)

Guidance on sequencing, parallel work, seasonal constraints, and a few example Gantt templates. Include notes on lead times and supplier SLAs.

### Budget (`budget/{budget-template}.md`)

Breakdowns and templates for estimating and tracking costs. Include example spreadsheets or CSV snippets for ingestion.

### Roles (`roles/{role}.md`)

Define stakeholder roles, scope, how to hire/contract them, typical costs, and what good looks like.

```markdown
# Role: {Role Name}

## What They Do
Core responsibilities and scope of this role in the process.

## Authority Level
What decisions this role can make:
- **Decision-maker:** {what they decide unilaterally}
- **Advisor:** {what they recommend but don't decide}
- **Executor:** {what they carry out}
- **Approver:** {what requires their sign-off}

## When They're Involved
Which phases this role participates in and how:
- [Phase X](../phases/{phase-x}.md) — {their role in this phase}
- [Phase Y](../phases/{phase-y}.md) — {their role in this phase}

## How to Find / Hire
Where to find this person, typical costs, red flags, what good looks like.

## Working With Them
Communication expectations, how often to check in, common friction points.
```

### Regulations (`regulations/{topic}.md`)

Permits, codes, licenses. Include jurisdiction notes and links to authoritative sources. Mark sensitive legal content as guidance, not legal advice.

### Templates (`templates/{template}.md`)

Contracts, purchase orders, RFIs, permit application checklists. Prefer short, editable templates.

### Exceptions (`exceptions/{exception}.md`)

Failure modes, escalation paths, and recovery procedures. While `gotchas/` captures preventive knowledge ("don't forget X"), exceptions capture reactive knowledge ("X happened, now what"). Every non-trivial process has failure modes — permits get denied, vendors go bankrupt, inspections fail, funding falls through.

```markdown
# Exception: {Failure Description}

## What Happened
The failure mode — what went wrong and how you'd recognize it.

## Which Phase(s)
Where in the process this can occur:
- [Phase X](../phases/{phase-x}.md) — {how it manifests in this phase}

## Impact
What this failure does to the overall process:
- **Timeline:** {delays, blocked phases}
- **Budget:** {additional costs, sunk costs}
- **Quality:** {compromises required}

## Escalation Path
Who needs to know and in what order:
1. {First contact — role, what to tell them}
2. {Second contact — if first can't resolve}

## Recovery Procedure
Step-by-step recovery:
1. {Immediate action — stop the bleeding}
2. {Assessment — understand scope of damage}
3. {Resolution — fix or work around}
4. {Verification — confirm recovery is complete}

## Fallback / Alternative
If recovery isn't possible, what's the alternative path?

## Prevention
How to reduce the likelihood of this failure in the future.
Link to relevant `gotchas/` entries.
```

**Guidelines:**
- One file per failure mode — keep them focused and independently retrievable
- Link exceptions to the phases where they can occur
- Include real examples when available (from `examples/` case studies)
- Distinguish between recoverable failures (fix and continue) and process-ending failures (must restart or abandon)

### Variants (`variants.md`)

Most real-world processes have major forks — building with a general contractor vs. owner-building, incorporating as an LLC vs. S-Corp, renovating a kitchen vs. a full gut job. `variants.md` documents these top-level forks and how they change the phase sequence.

```markdown
# Process Variants

## Default Path
Brief description of the "standard" path the phase sequence assumes.

## Variant: {Variant Name}

### When to Choose This
Under what circumstances this variant applies.

### How It Differs
Which phases change, which are skipped, which are added:
- **{Phase X}:** {modified — what's different}
- **{Phase Y}:** {skipped in this variant}
- **{New Phase}:** {added — only in this variant}

### Implications
- **Timeline:** {faster/slower, by how much}
- **Budget:** {cheaper/more expensive, why}
- **Risk:** {higher/lower, what changes}
- **Professional requirements:** {different roles needed}

## Variant: {Next Variant}
...
```

**Guidelines:**
- Phase files reference `variants.md` and include a `## Variants` section noting how they change per variant
- Variants are not separate packs — they're documented forks within one pack
- If a variant changes more than ~60% of the phases, consider whether it should be a separate process pack instead

### Examples and Retrospectives (`examples/`)

Case studies, post-mortems, and retrospective learnings. Include a `## Lessons Learned` section in every example to feed continuous improvement.

```markdown
# Example: {Case Study Title}

## Context
Who did this, when, and under what constraints.

## What Happened
Narrative of how the process played out — decisions made, surprises encountered.

## Outcome
Results — timeline, budget, quality compared to plan.

## Lessons Learned
What worked well, what didn't, and what the person would do differently.
Link to relevant `gotchas/` or `exceptions/` entries that were created
or validated by this experience.
```

### Resources, Gotchas, FAQ

Keep these as before but follow the small-file guideline. Cross-link heavily.

## Agent Consumption Patterns

- Start with `overview.md` (Tier 1) to route the user's question and understand the phase map.
- Use `_index.md` files to identify candidate files.
- Prefer `fundamentals/` and `glossary/` for conceptual questions.
- Use `phases/` for step-by-step guidance and `checklists/` for action items.
- Check `phases/{phase}.md` **Inputs / Prerequisites** to determine readiness before advising someone to start a phase.
- Use `decisions/` for tradeoff reasoning and `budget/` and `scheduling/` for planning tasks.
- When the user's situation involves a variant (e.g., "I'm owner-building"), load `variants.md` first, then load phase files with awareness of variant-specific differences.
- When something goes wrong, check `exceptions/` for failure-specific recovery procedures — don't confuse with `gotchas/` (which is preventive, not reactive).
- Load `templates/` and full `budget/` spreadsheets on demand (Tier 3).
- Reference `examples/` for real-world context and lessons learned.

---

## Sourcing Guidance

Prioritize practitioner interviews for decisions and gotchas. Use authoritative sources for regulations. Capture real timelines and budgets from case studies in `examples/`.
